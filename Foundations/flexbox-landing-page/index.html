                        The Miniature Pinscher is a small, sturdy, and energetic
                        dog known as the "king of toys" for its proud, big-dog
                        personality and love of play. Physically, it is
                        characterized by a compact, wedge-shaped body, a smooth,
                        short coat, and a distinctive high-stepping "hackney"
                        gait. They are intelligent, alert, and fearless, with a
                        loyal but sometimes aloof nature, making them good
                        watchdogs that can also be quite vocal.
